## Executive summary

Write a one-paragraph abstract summarizing what you did and your findings. It need not be comprehensive; try to highlight the most important or interesting outcomes.

## Data description

Data collection: The dataset comes from the PSTAT 197a capstone intake survey which was given to the capstone students via google forms due on September 30. Responses were exported to CSV and accessible on GitHub. The repo includes three files: (1) background-clean.csv - background and preparation; (2) interest-clean.csv - project interests and preferred programming language and (3) survey-metadata.csv - a data dictionary mapping variable names to survey sections and the original question text.

**Sample:** Each record is one student and is keyed by response_id. We noticed 51-52 responses in total. when combining files, we join on response_id. This is a sample of enrolled capstone students (not UCSB as a whole). Some nonresponse is present because some students skipped individual questions.

**Measurements.** • Proficiency and confidence: prog.prof, math.prof, and stat.prof are ordered proficiency categories (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced). prog.comf, math.comf, and stat.comf are integer ratings of confidence • Coursework background: upper-division coursework into 0--2, 3--5, 6--8, and 9+; additional columns indicate specific courses taken • Prior experience: boolean indicator of prior research experience (Yes/No) • Interests and language preference: in interest-clean.csv, lang records preferred programming language (R, Python, or No preference), type indicates preferred project type (individual vs both), and dom/area capture broader domains and specific areas of interest (multi-select, stored as semicolon-separated strings). • Metadata: survey-metadata.csv has variable names, survey sections (personal/background/interest), and original question wording.

## Questions of interest:

We sought to understand how students’ academic preparation and background factors relate to their technical proficiency and language preferences. Specifically, our analysis addressed two key questions:

1.  How does prior coursework relate to self-assessed proficiency in programming, mathematics, and statistics?
2.  What factors, such as major, prior experience, and confidence, appear to influence which programming languages students prefer or feel most comfortable using?

## Findings

Summarize your results. Don't try to explain every step you took; focus instead on providing the main data analytic outputs -- tables and figures -- and explaining clearly what they show. Clarify any important decisions you made in obtaining them. You can display codes if you like but it is not necessary.
