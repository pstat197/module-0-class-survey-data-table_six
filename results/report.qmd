## Executive summary

Write a one-paragraph abstract summarizing what you did and your findings. It need not be comprehensive; try to highlight the most important or interesting outcomes.

## Data description

Data collection: The dataset comes from the PSTAT 197a capstone intake survey which was given to the capstone students via google forms due on September 30. Responses were exported to CSV and accessible on GitHub. The repo includes three files: (1) background-clean.csv - background and preparation; (2) interest-clean.csv - project interests and preferred programming language and (3) survey-metadata.csv - a data dictionary mapping variable names to survey sections and the original question text.

**Sample:** Each record is one student and is keyed by response_id. We noticed 51-52 responses in total. when combining files, we join on response_id. This is a sample of enrolled capstone students (not UCSB as a whole). Some nonresponse is present because some students skipped individual questions.

**Measurements.**
• Proficiency and confidence: prog.prof, math.prof, and stat.prof are ordered proficiency categories (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced). prog.comf, math.comf, and stat.comf are integer ratings of confidence
• Coursework background: upper-division coursework into 0--2, 3--5, 6--8, and 9+; additional columns indicate specific courses taken
• Prior experience: boolean indicator of prior research experience (Yes/No)
• Interests and language preference: in interest-clean.csv, lang records preferred programming language (R, Python, or No preference), type indicates preferred project type (individual vs both), and dom/area capture broader domains and specific areas of interest (multi-select, stored as semicolon-separated strings).
• Metadata: survey-metadata.csv has variable names, survey sections (personal/background/interest), and original question wording.

## Questions of interest

Indicate the questions your analysis addresses. These should map one-to-one to your findings. Don't include questions you didn't answer or questions you started with and refined later. If you would rather frame them as goals or tasks rather than questions that is okay; just modify the header appropriately. However you frame what you've done, you may only have two or three items; that is fine. Provide an itemized or numbered list so that the reader can easily identify your objectives.

For example:

> *We sought to understand the relationship between coursework preparation, self-assessed technical abilities, and comfort level with technical skills. We also sought to understand whether the relationships differed depending on having had prior research experience. Our analysis addressed three questions:*
>
> 1.  *How should the coursework histories of students in the class be ordered from less preparation to extensive preparation?*
> 2.  *Is coursework preparation associated with increased self-assessed technical skill and comfort within the sample?*
> 3.  *Does prior research experience appear to be a substitute for coursework preparation with respect to self-assessed technical skill and comfort?*

Notice that the questions are precise but not overly technical.

## Findings

Summarize your results. Don't try to explain every step you took; focus instead on providing the main data analytic outputs -- tables and figures -- and explaining clearly what they show. Clarify any important decisions you made in obtaining them. You can display codes if you like but it is not necessary.
